## MemSQL on the AWS Cloud

This Quick Start helps you to deploy MemSQL, a distributed, highly scalable SQL database, on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud.

MemSQL ingests data continuously to perform operational analytics on billions of rows of data in relational SQL, JSON, geospatial, and full-text search formats. MemSQL can handle both database workloads and data warehouse workloads, meeting transactional and analytical requirements. Together, MemSQL and AWS provide a compelling platform for building real-time applications.

You can use the AWS CloudFormation templates included with the Quick Start to deploy MemSQL in your AWS account in 5-15 minutes, depending on the number of instances chosen. The Quick Start automates the following:

- Deploying MemSQL into a new VPC
- Deploying MemSQL into an existing VPC

You can also use the AWS CloudFormation templates as a starting point for your own implementation.
